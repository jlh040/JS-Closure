## JavaScript Closure Exercise

- This repository is my solution to Springboard exercise 48.3.11.
- In this exercise I was tasked with utilizing my knowledge of JS closures to implement three functions.
- In **guessing-game.js** I wrote a function allowing a user to guess a number between 0 and 99.
- In **create-account.js** I wrote a function that mimics a user's bank account, allowing them to check their balance, withdraw money, deposit money, and change their pin.
- In **curried-add.js** I wrote a function that will return another function if a number is passed in, and return a sum of all numbers passed to it so far if no numbers are passed in.

## Testing

Paste the following in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlh040/JS-Closure.git && npm install && jest
```
